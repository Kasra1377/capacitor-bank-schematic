Capacitor banks are widely used in power system grids and industries to decrease the overall current from the upstream network and power stations. Industirial Capacitor banks, without injecting or absorbing active power (P), inject or absorb reactive power (Q) in such a way to decrease the overall current from upstream network and more importantly keep the power factor above 0.9 to avoid penalties for the utility owner from the distribution company. This decreased current leads to lower cable size and heating in the grid.

This repository provides a complete schematic diagram sample of a real-world 400V capacitor bank that is utilized by industries. These schematics include the internal (that is detailed with different components) and external side of a capacitor bank frame. It is noteworthy that the frame and its components (e.g., contactors, MCCBs, capacitor contractors, etc.) are detailed and were drawn using Autocad Electrical, and for assembling in the frame, the files are imported and drawn in EPLAN software. Additionally, apart from the capacitor bank frame, the diagram and electrical wiring of the capacitor bank were done with EPLAN.

The compenents that are used in the bank includes:
1. One EasyCan Capacitor - 25/30 kvar - 400V - 50/60Hz
2. Two EasyCan Capacitor - 12.5/15 kvar - 400V - 50/60Hz
3. One LED Enclosure Light - PLD E 409 W 350
4. Three Capacitor Contactors, TeSys D, 25 kVAR - 400V - 50Hz
5. One Capacitor Contactors, TeSys D, 12.5 kVAR - 400V - 50Hz
6. One Circuit Breaker (MCCB) Easypact 160 A 3P
7. Three Miniature Circuit Breaker (MCB) - 6 A - 3P - C Curve
8. Three Miniature Circuit Breaker (MCB) - 63 A - 3P - C Curve
9. Three Miniature Circuit Breaker (MCB) - 32 A - 3P - C Curve
10. One Selector Switch
11. Three Start-Stop Buttons
12. One Capacitor Regulator

The screenshots of the schematics are included down below, and corresponding schematic PDFs are included in the 'schematics' folder.
